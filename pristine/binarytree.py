"""
BinaryTreeNode represents a rooted binary tree where each node tracks its parent,
children, and time. This class is central to phylogenetic models where trees encode
ancestral relationships, branching times, and evolutionary structure.

Each node has pointers to its left and right child, and its 'time' field represents
the node's position along the temporal axisâ€”typically interpreted as the divergence
time from its ancestor. The tree can be traversed or modified using methods like
bfs(), drop_tip(), or grow_aldous_tree().

Functionally, BinaryTreeNode supports both structural operations and data-driven
tasks. For example, edgelist() extracts edges and branch durations; tip_indices()
returns the leaves of the tree; and newick() builds a Newick-formatted string for
compatibility with external tools.

The class also enables forward-time simulation of trees via grow_aldous_tree(),
and supports visualization and reindexing to maintain consistent node identifiers.
It is designed to integrate easily with statistical and computational models by
storing arbitrary data at each node, including sequences, rates, or latent states.
